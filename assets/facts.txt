The first computer programmer was a female mathematician.
Many machines did simple math, but Charles Babbage’s Analytical Machine was the first computer we consider “programmable”.
Computer programming played an important role in ending World War II.
There are currently over 700 computer languages.
The “C” programming language had a predecessor called “B”.
For the programming language 'Python', its name isn’t about snakes, but about the popular British comedy troupe Monty Python.
Companies such as NASA, Google, IBM, Walt Disney Feature Animation, Facebook, and Netflix use Python.
